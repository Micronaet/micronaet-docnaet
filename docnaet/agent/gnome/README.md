Registering a Protocol on Linux

gconftool-2 -t string -s /desktop/gnome/url-handlers/foo/command 'foo "%s"'
gconftool-2 -s /desktop/gnome/url-handlers/foo/needs_terminal false -t bool
gconftool-2 -s /desktop/gnome/url-handlers/foo/enabled true -t bool

Then put the settings from your local gconf file into the global defaults in:

/etc/gconf/gconf.xml.defaults/%gconf-tree.xml

This specifically mentions 64-bit but the same thing works on 32-bit as well. 
Also, even though the change is only in the Gnome settings, it also works for 
KDE because apparently Firefox/Iceweasel defers to gnome-open regardless of what window manager you are running when it encounters a prefix which it doesn't understand (such as foo://). So, other browsers, like Konqueror in KDE, won't work under this scenario.
